# RingsAndModules
My typed notes (mainly statements and definitions) for the course Rings and Modules, followed in Padova during the AY 2019-2020.
These were mainly meant to improve my TeX capabilities (especially with respect to the usage of vim, with ultisnips
and the ability to type commutative diagrams), not to be published as reference notes.
Only a few proofs appear in the text, mostly with just the most interesting/useful ideas.
